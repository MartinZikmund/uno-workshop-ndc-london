- we'll make sure that we have a Figma account and have the Uno Figma plugin installed
- we'll open the Material Design file and briefly explain how it works for our designer
- we'll open the Calculator Design file and export the XAML / C# Markup replacing the code we had in the previous module and make the necessary updates to see how we could have gotten our UI quicker
